"Maximizing our potential as a learning organising is central to meeting Spotify’s Mission to unlock the potential of human creativity—by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it. Business leaders and product teams depend on learnings to inform their daily decisions by understanding how people experience music through products.

Good data is the starting place for great insights. Having a strong data for insights practice across the company will enable our insights teams to produce high quality learnings quickly and scale efficiently. We are looking for an experienced Data Scientist or Analytics/Data Engineer to join the band and lead us on the journey to be masters of this practice.
What you’ll do:
• Working across our embedded community of data scientists and engineers — and partnering closely with central tooling and infrastructure teams — you’ll lead Spotify’s effort to minimize... duplication and hours spent on discovering, generating and preparing data to a state where it’s optimised for insights.
• By engaging across disciplines you’ll develop a practice that’s easy for others to adopt and is equally easy for others to contribute to. You’ll build and maintain an evolving set of shared principles, shared tools, shared knowledge and most importantly shared behaviours for how we produce and manage data for insights across the company.
• To tackle the data for insights challenges at Spotify, we’ll need to work across the entire data preparation workflow, including generating data through instrumentation, normalising data into easy to query tables and producing flat tables that are ready to analyse. When light touch support to the community is not enough, you will embed in other teams to solve problems and develop new community resources as a result. When input to central support teams is not enough, we embed with our partners there to help design, build and activate shared data, tooling and /or infrastructure.

"ABOUT US

Simon Data was founded in 2015 by a team of successful serial entrepreneurs. We're a data-first marketing platform startup, and we approach our work seriously; we tackle problems in a scrappy and disruptive fashion, yet we build for scale to support our clients at big data volume.

We are the first and only enterprise customer data platform with a fully-integrated marketing cloud. Moving beyond the limitations of both categories, Simon’s platform empowers businesses to leverage enterprise-scale big data and machine learning to power customer communications in any channel. Simon’s unique approach allows brands to develop incredible personalization capabilities without needing to build and maintain massive bespoke data infrastructure.

Our culture is rooted in organizational transparency, empowering individuals, and an attitude of getting things done. If you want to be a valuable contributor on a team that cultivates these core values we would love to hear from you.

THE... ROLE

As a Data Scientist at Simon, you will be working as part of a collaborative/user focused team and be responsible for designing and building smart systems that drive revenue—our statistical models are at the core of our product, and will only become more so as we continue to develop and add features. We take an approach to ML that is data-first, and requires principled modeling decisions: we don’t believe in theory-crafting models before we have collected the data that will power them, as well as built out the business process that will continue to generate that data. In the model building process, we prioritize interpretable models whose training and performance yield insights about the underlying process, along with optimizing the selected objective.

Our technologies of choice are Python in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend, and our tech stack includes Django, MySQL, Redshift, S3, DynamoDB, and Elasticsearch storage, asynchronous tasks over RabbitMQ, and distributed data processing over Elastic MapReduce and Spark.

WHAT YOU’LL DO
• Build ML products that leverage Simon’s extraordinary data access to drive real business value
• Build high-quality statistical models by executing the entire model-building process, including data cleaning, feature extraction, model selection, and predictive validation
• Contribute to the tooling and interfaces used to support the data science process at Simon
• Represent Simon DS in conversations with stakeholders at our client companies
• Advance Simon as a thought leader in data science, by writing blog posts and papers, and presenting at industry conferences
• Guide internal product and technology strategy by representing data science perspectives and requirements in conversations with your peers

QUALIFICATIONS

"About Citizen

Citizen’s mission is to protect the world. We began by opening the NYC and San Francisco 911 system to local Citizen app users, creating access to real-time crime and safety information. By increasing situational awareness and transparency, we hope communities will become safer than ever before.

Since our launch, 6% of New Yorkers use our app every month, and that growth is accelerating. We launched San Francisco last fall, and over 1% has already joined the Citizen safety network. We send over 4 million nearby crime notifications each month, alerting our users to emergencies and dangerous situations near them. Citizen broke both recent NYC terror incidents to people nearby, keeping thousands in the vicinity safer and informed in real-time. Citizen has been featured on local NYC news over 100 times in the past 3 months.

We’re looking for passionate, mission-driven individuals to help take the Citizen app to the next level as we scale up new cities and expand... globally.

Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital and Founder’s Fund.

Our Challenges
• Scaling: We have one of the fastest growing organic user bases in NYC, and right now we’re geo-restricted to New York City and San Francisco. Soon we will launch nationwide and we need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
• Bursting: Without warning, a major incident occurs and multiple users begin live-streaming video into the app. We notify the entire user base, causing a massive burst of simultaneously connected clients. The core systems we build need to efficiently support traffic that can grow to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users today, and millions in the future.
• Analytics: We want to alert users to incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
• Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
• Extracting signal from noise: During major breaking news events, tensions are high and a lack of information persists. We build tools to raise facts and suppress noise.
• FM radio: We use software-defined radios to consume all radio dispatch in NYC, SF and eventually every major city, whether analog, digital, or trunked.

Our Stack - languages and technologies we use and teach
• Mobile: Swift (iOS), Java (Android)
• Web: React.js
• Server: Go, Node (for isolated systems)
• Systems: MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Firebase (for isolated systems)
• Infrastructure: Kubernetes on GCP

Role Description
• Our core challenges come from intersecting our growing internal datasets on user behavior and real time crime, fire, and medical incidents with large, messy external datasets from governmental and private sources.
• Work with a wide array of real-world data sources, with an inclination towards experimentation, to find new and better data sources that allow us to further customize our users’ notifications and overall experience.
• Work with the executive team in support of our mission by helping inform Mayors, Governors, Chiefs of Police, and other public figures with data-led analysis of the impact of Citizen on crime
• Lead projects that derive value from our unique, rich, and rapidly growing data.
• Distilling questions, wrangling data, and driving decisions with data analytics.
• Work with Engineering to evangelize data best practices and implement data analytics solutions.
• Working with Product to inform prioritization of roadmap through data analytics

Requirements
• Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, Math, Statistics, or related field.
• 5+ years of experience in data science or analytics.
• Proficiency in programming/scripting and experience with statistical packages like R, Python/Pandas, etc.
• Strong knowledge of relational databases and ability to write SQL code at an expert level.
• Aptitude with numbers, intellectual curiosity about metrics and measuring impact.
• Enjoys teaching and collaborating with others.

"The Democratic National Committee’s Tech Team is hiring a Data Scientist to help us provide candidates and state parties a set of product that will optimize their voter contact programs. The Tech Team works closely with campaigns up and down the ballot to provide them the tools and data they need to win.

Who we are:
The Tech Team is a small, diverse team that provides technology, datasets, and data products used by candidates and organizers in all 50 states and in all 3,413 counties across the United States. The Tech Team’s efforts directly give support to analyze data, organize campaigns, define targets, raise money, and get out the vote on Election Day.

We are building a team geared to take on the biggest challenges. So we are hiring analysts, product managers, engineers, researchers, designers, security experts, IT professionals, client support, and data scientists who can use user-centered design and rapid iteration to develop a rich technology ecosystem for progressives –... building tools ourselves as well as partnering with other companies and organizations.

Who you are:
We're focused on equipping candidates and campaigns around the country with the data and analytics resources they need to win, and are looking for Data Scientists with a diverse range of backgrounds and skill sets to help us tackle numerous projects.

You will be part of the DNC's Data Team and will focus on both 1) the near-term operational efficiency of the DNC, state parties, and candidates and 2) the long-range development of groundbreaking products for the progressive ecosystem at large.
Among other things, in this role you could help us:
• Audit and improve our existing data science products and pipelines. Help us continue building upon and improving our models, the pipelines that produce them, and other data science products we provide.
• Build new predictive models for more efficient voter outreach. In cases where a new model is needed, help leverage our existing data and identify new data sources to create new and better predictions.
• Analyze historical data to improve current programs. Use data from past cycles and programs to help campaigns run the best possible programs moving forward.
• Identify opportunities to develop new tools and products that help Democrats fully leverage data in their decision-making. Work on better understanding the end users of Democratic data and building the tools that best meet their needs. Help us think about how we can make data, analytics, and data science products more impactful and accessible to the campaigns that rely on them.
• Design and analyze experiments that will help the party run efficient programs going forward. Help us improve how campaigns find and reach the right voters across all of their programs; how they define and measure success across outreach efforts; and how we set up systems to be able to continually test assumptions.

You might be right for this role if you:
• Have experience doing data science or statistics in a social sciences context, which may include electoral politics.
• Feel comfortable with R (and/or Python) and SQL.
• Have experience with predictive modeling, statistical inference, and/or experiment design.
• Have strong written and verbal communication skills, and experience explaining technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. You won’t just be building data science products, but you’ll be helping us ensure our diverse users trust them and know how to use them for their individual needs.
• Are curious, collaborative, and humble – ready to work with a diverse, distributed team to solve interesting problems together.

Do you want to...
• Secure the future of our country? Right now a lot is at stake in our country and our team has a huge opportunity to make a real difference.
• Work with amazing people? We’re building a diverse, distributed team, hiring the best people we can wherever they are—alumni from past Presidential campaigns working out of DC and New York, experienced product developers from the SF Bay Area, and more.
• Never stop learning? There are people who know about politics and people who know about technology and a few who have figured out some things about how to combine the two, but we are blazing a lot of new trails and you should be comfortable exploring and learning from everyone you can.

You can work from our headquarters in Washington, D.C.; with a concentration of folks in the San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, or Chicago; or remotely from wherever you are. We’re definitely looking for someone with a few years of relevant work experience but we don’t require previous experience in politics. If you are coming from industry, however, be aware that some things are different in the world of politics: while we've done some budget hacking so we can be competitive when it comes to salaries we know we can’t beat Google or Facebook.
