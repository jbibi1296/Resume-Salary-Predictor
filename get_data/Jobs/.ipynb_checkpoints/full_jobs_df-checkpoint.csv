201,123.8,"About Trialspark

Today, the biggest bottleneck in bringing new treatments to patients is the clinical trial. On average, getting a drug through the trial process takes nearly a decade and frequently costs $100M+. And the problem is only getting worse.

At TrialSpark, we don’t believe it has to be this way. Through technology and a new operational model, we’re reimaging how clinical trials are run, with the mission of bringing new treatments to patients faster.

We do this by partnering with physicians to enable them to run clinical trials within their existing practices. By providing the technology platform, equipment, and staffing,TrialSpark alleviates the operational burden of clinical research, enabling physicians to focus on what they do best -- patient care. And by bringing clinical research to physician practices, TrialSpark is enabling access for the 98% of patients who are never exposed to clinical trial opportunities.

About the role

Delivering a clinical trial across... multiple trial sites is a highly complex endeavor, involving lots of different people, processes, and logistics. And running numerous clinical trials at once, across a nationwide site network, increases the complexity of the problem exponentially.

As a Senior Operations Analyst, your focus will be helping us to manage this complexity. You will be responsible for developing a deep, data-driven understanding of our operational model and identifying the key leverage points to drive greater efficiency. You’ll map out the exact activities required to deliver a clinical trial and locate opportunities to reduce time and cost. Example questions you’ll help us answer include:
• How many people do we need to staff a clinical trial? What are the primary drivers of the size and makeup of the team? Given the needs of the trial and the workloads, capabilities, and geographical locations of the various team members, who should be included in the team?
• What does it cost to run a clinical trial? What are the major drivers of these costs and what improvements can we make to the model to drive efficiency? Where do we build vs. buy software?
• In what ways can we optimize our physical trial operations? Can we better route our staff and resources between sites? What does an efficient clinical logistics network look like?
• Based on the forecasted growth of the business, how many people do we need to hire for each role, and by when?

About you

This is a core operational role for TrialSpark, We’re looking for highly talented candidates with an extensive background in analytical problem solving. Candidates for this role should be able to take complex, open-ended problems and develop structured, data-driven solutions.

An ideal candidate:
• You have a deep analytical background with experience in an Operational science or research capacity, and are passionate about breaking down and understanding complex systems end-to-end. Prior experience could include data science, operations, consulting, or finance.
• You have strong technical chops — you’ve lived in Excel, can write SELECT statements in your sleep, and can Python or R your way in and out of any situation.
• You are excited about working cross-functionally with operations, finance, product, engineering, and data to develop innovative solutions to challenging operational problems.
• You are proactive, strategic, implementation-focused, and ready to roll up your sleeves and make an impact right away
• You are low ego, collaborative, and a fast-learner

Citizen’s mission is to protect the world. We began by opening the NYC and San Francisco 911 system to local Citizen app users, creating access to real-time crime and safety information. By increasing situational awareness and transparency, we hope communities will become safer than ever before.

Since our launch, 6% of New Yorkers use our app every month, and that growth is accelerating. We launched San Francisco last fall, and over 1% has already joined the Citizen safety network. We send over 4 million nearby crime notifications each month, alerting our users to emergencies and dangerous situations near them. Citizen broke both recent NYC terror incidents to people nearby, keeping thousands in the vicinity safer and informed in real-time. Citizen has been featured on local NYC news over 100 times in the past 3 months.

We’re looking for passionate, mission-driven individuals to help take the Citizen app to the next level as we scale up new cities and expand... globally.

Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital and Founder’s Fund.

Our Challenges
• Scaling: We have one of the fastest growing organic user bases in NYC, and right now we’re geo-restricted to New York City and San Francisco. Soon we will launch nationwide and we need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
• Bursting: Without warning, a major incident occurs and multiple users begin live-streaming video into the app. We notify the entire user base, causing a massive burst of simultaneously connected clients. The core systems we build need to efficiently support traffic that can grow to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users today, and millions in the future.
• Analytics: We want to alert users to incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
• Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
• Extracting signal from noise: During major breaking news events, tensions are high and a lack of information persists. We build tools to raise facts and suppress noise.
• FM radio: We use software-defined radios to consume all radio dispatch in NYC, SF and eventually every major city, whether analog, digital, or trunked.

Our Stack - languages and technologies we use and teach
• Mobile: Swift (iOS), Java (Android)
• Web: React.js
• Server: Go, Node (for isolated systems)
• Systems: MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Firebase (for isolated systems)
• Infrastructure: Kubernetes on GCP

Role Description
• Our core challenges come from intersecting our growing internal datasets on user behavior and real time crime, fire, and medical incidents with large, messy external datasets from governmental and private sources.
• Work with a wide array of real-world data sources to help drive Company strategy, guide product roadmap, and enhance user engagement.
• Execute ad hoc analyses and special projects as we operationalize our data driven insights
• Work with the executive team in support of our mission by helping inform Mayors, Governors, Chiefs of Police, and other public figures with data-led analysis of the impact of Citizen on crime
• Work with Engineering to evangelize data best practices and implement scalable data analytics solutions.

260,123.8,"About Trialspark
Today, the biggest bottleneck in bringing new treatments to patients is the clinical trial. On average, getting a drug through the trial process takes nearly a decade and frequently costs $100M+. And the problem is only getting worse.
At TrialSpark, we don’t believe it has to be this way. Through technology and a new operational model, we’re reimaging how clinical trials are run, with the mission of bringing new treatments to patients faster.
We do this by partnering with physicians to enable them to run clinical trials within their existing practices. By providing the technology platform, equipment, and staffing,TrialSpark alleviates the operational burden of clinical research, enabling physicians to focus on what they do best -- patient care. And by bringing clinical research to physician practices, TrialSpark is enabling access for the 98% of patients who are never exposed to clinical trial opportunities.
About the role
Delivering a clinical trial across multiple... trial sites is a highly complex endeavor, involving lots of different people, processes, and logistics. And running numerous clinical trials at once, across a nationwide site network, increases the complexity of the problem exponentially.
As a Senior Operations Analyst, your focus will be helping us to manage this complexity. You will be responsible for developing a deep, data-driven understanding of our operational model and identifying the key leverage points to drive greater efficiency. You’ll map out the exact activities required to deliver a clinical trial and locate opportunities to reduce time and cost. Example questions you’ll help us answer include:
How many people do we need to staff a clinical trial? What are the primary drivers of the size and makeup of the team? Given the needs of the trial and the workloads, capabilities, and geographical locations of the various team members, who should be included in the team?
What does it cost to run a clinical trial? What are the major drivers of these costs and what improvements can we make to the model to drive efficiency? Where do we build vs. buy software?
In what ways can we optimize our physical trial operations? Can we better route our staff and resources between sites? What does an efficient clinical logistics network look like?
Based on the forecasted growth of the business, how many people do we need to hire for each role, and by when?
About you
This is a core operational role for TrialSpark, We’re looking for highly talented candidates with an extensive background in analytical problem solving. Candidates for this role should be able to take complex, open-ended problems and develop structured, data-driven solutions.
An ideal candidate:
You have a deep analytical background with experience in an Operational science or research capacity, and are passionate about breaking down and understanding complex systems end-to-end. Prior experience could include data science, operations, consulting, or finance.
You have strong technical chops — you’ve lived in Excel, can write SELECT statements in your sleep, and can Python or R your way in and out of any situation.
You are excited about working cross-functionally with operations, finance, product, engineering, and data to develop innovative solutions to challenging operational problems.
You are proactive, strategic, implementation-focused, and ready to roll up your sleeves and make an impact right away

As the media industry grapples with fragmentation and disruption, a key facet of Research is to be the driving force in helping their company capture, report on, monetize, and understand audiences. An opportunity lies in Research to work across divisions and departments to create a unified language that ensures that internal clients understand-and take advantage of-complex metrics. The key is giving the necessary context so that decisions can be made. While this sounds disarmingly simple, it is a challenge to get the majority of the company to speak the same language and understand new vernacular. Research is a central force within the broader organization in gaining an objective perspective for a wide array of complex questions. It may sound academic – and certainly there is a portion of the job that requires a love of learning – but the primary attribute that will bring you success is curiosity. For example, you'll gain a deeper understanding of what motivates someone to tune into a show, buy a product based on placement of an ad, become a fan on social media, or why certain types of programs are successful across regions of this country and abroad. Ultimately, each research candidate gets a better understanding of the rigor that goes into making business decisions by uncovering not boulders, but pebbles along the path to connecting to A E Networks core asset, its content.

342,164.1,"About the right team member:

As a Data Engineer at Betterment, you will tackle a diverse set of data-oriented problems, working with a wide range of teams and learning a great deal about finance in the process. One morning you might work with our Finance team to construct data domains in Redshift that will allow them to hone and quickly tweak our financial model, and then spend the afternoon strategizing with our front-end application team on how to coordinate internal APIs that allow us to serve up historical data to customers in our applications. The next day you might assist our Operations team in automating the production of equities reconciliation reports, then close out the evening by hopping over to our Data Science team to get them the data they need to compare the effectiveness of TV advertisements in San Francisco and New York. If there’s data involved, you’re the one curating it - making it accessible, and ensuring it’s correct. A Data Engineer at Betterment can expect to... approach tasks such as these on a daily basis, leveraging our existing processes and using their prior experience to improve the way we handle data at Betterment.

This role can be based out of our headquarters in NYC or our brand new Philadelphia office.

At Betterment you will get to:
• Work on increasing the efficiency of our ETL processes as the size of Betterment’s data grows 10x annually
• Explore new technologies that will allow us to keep our internal API response times low even as throughput grows
• Move quickly to provide analysts with new data before they ask for it
• Investigate how we can enhance our logging and monitoring to discover and resolve issues before they cause problems
• Think about scale and new technologies that will enable us to achieve a high level of service as Betterment is managing hundreds of billions of dollars

You will be effective if you have:
• Have deep expertise in at least one object-oriented language, such as Java, Ruby, or Python
• Know how to handle an explosion of data without missing a beat
• Can optimize a query with the best of them
• Are the person at your current job that everyone goes to for database help, even though you aren’t necessarily a DBA
• Are so good at automating things that you’re constantly programming yourself out of a job
• Have a passion for software engineering, and for creating what doesn’t exist
• Know how to make the tradeoffs required to ship without compromising quality
• Appreciate agility and pragmatism in software development
• Thrive in a startup environment
• Have the grit to see projects through to their conclusion

Tools in your belt:
• Development: OO languages such as Python, frameworks such as Flask or Ruby on Rails, Advanced SQL
• Datastores: Redshift or other columnar stores, Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB or other NoSQL stores
• Technologies: Event Streaming, Caching tools, MapReduce
• Platforms: AWS!

Betterment’s Data Engineering team spends most of its time with the tools above, but we cast a much wider net in other parts of the engineering team. We strive to always choose the best tool for the job. We maintain most of our ETL and orchestration in Python, but we serve up data to customers through APIs in a lightweight caching application built in Rails. The person for whom we’re looking will be a pro who can guide both our data pipeline development as well as our customer-facing APIs.

Business leaders and product teams depend on learnings to inform their daily decisions by understanding how people experience music through products.

Good data is the starting place for great insights. Having a strong data for insights practice across the company will enable our insights teams to produce high quality learnings quickly and scale efficiently.

You’ll build and maintain an evolving set of shared principles, shared tools, shared knowledge and most importantly shared behaviours for how we produce and manage data for insights across the company.
• To tackle the data for insights challenges at Spotify, we’ll need to work across the entire data preparation workflow, including generating data through instrumentation, normalising data into easy to query tables and producing flat tables that are ready to analyse. When light touch support to the community is not enough, you will embed in other teams to solve problems and develop new community resources as a result. When input to central support teams is not enough, we embed with our partners there to help design, build and activate shared data, tooling and /or infrastructure.
• You’ll work with data scientists to cultivate a shared practice for defining data collection requirements across all of our experiences. You’ll partner with central tooling and infrastructure teams to make sure it’s trivally easy for these requirements to be implemented by product teams.
• You’ll work with dedicated data production teams to identify opportunity to produce datasets centrally. You’ll be the lead designer for Spotify’s data, modelling data across the company and helping teams to identify and design data interoperably with their bounded context. You’ll work closely with tooling and infrastructure teams to ensure we have the tools we need to make it easy to produce and manage data for insights. When input is not enough, you’ll embed with our partners to help design, build or activate shared data, tooling and infrastructure.

Who you are
• You’re passionate about the role of modelled, analyst friendly data in maximizing a company’s potential as a learning organisation. Your passion for good practice is infectious. As you continuously improve your own practice, Spotify’s practice will improve alongside you.
• You’re collaborative. You work hands on with a wide variety of teams to ensure that both the most recent needs of the community are reflected in our shared practice and that behaviours of the community are changing to adopt it. When there are competing shared practices you facilitate discussions, providing your experienced perspective where needed, in order to establish a single view, e.g. the guiding principles or when to use which practice. When infrastructure is missing or incomplete you surface the needs and work with infra teams to ensure that they are understood.
• You’re innovative. You’re a builder. You show people the value of your ideas by bringing them to life in tangible, innovative ways. You work closely with central engineering and infrastructure teams to tackle the most complex challenges at Spotify are addressed in a sustainable way.
• You’re playful. You’re always looking for new ways to engage across disciplines to build engagement and cultivate a shared sense of ownership of the practice.
• You’re sincere. As community lead, you take an active interest in your own development and the development of other data scientists across the organisation.
• You have 5+ years as a practicing data scientist, analyst or data/analytics engineer.
• You have a high level of ability in data science languages such as SQL and Python and/or R.

THE... ROLE

As a Data Scientist at Simon, you will be working as part of a collaborative/user focused team and be responsible for designing and building smart systems that drive revenue—our statistical models are at the core of our product, and will only become more so as we continue to develop and add features. We take an approach to ML that is data-first, and requires principled modeling decisions: we don’t believe in theory-crafting models before we have collected the data that will power them, as well as built out the business process that will continue to generate that data. In the model building process, we prioritize interpretable models whose training and performance yield insights about the underlying process, along with optimizing the selected objective.

Our technologies of choice are Python in the backend and React/Redux in the frontend, and our tech stack includes Django, MySQL, Redshift, S3, DynamoDB, and Elasticsearch storage, asynchronous tasks over RabbitMQ, and distributed data processing over Elastic MapReduce and Spark.

WHAT YOU’LL DO
• Build ML products that leverage Simon’s extraordinary data access to drive real business value

483,166.5,"About Citizen

Citizen’s mission is to protect the world. We began by opening the NYC and San Francisco 911 system to local Citizen app users, creating access to real-time crime and safety information. By increasing situational awareness and transparency, we hope communities will become safer than ever before.

Since our launch, 6% of New Yorkers use our app every month, and that growth is accelerating. We launched San Francisco last fall, and over 1% has already joined the Citizen safety network. We send over 4 million nearby crime notifications each month, alerting our users to emergencies and dangerous situations near them. Citizen broke both recent NYC terror incidents to people nearby, keeping thousands in the vicinity safer and informed in real-time. Citizen has been featured on local NYC news over 100 times in the past 3 months.

We’re looking for passionate, mission-driven individuals to help take the Citizen app to the next level as we scale up new cities and expand... globally.

Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital and Founder’s Fund.

Our Challenges
• Scaling: We have one of the fastest growing organic user bases in NYC, and right now we’re geo-restricted to New York City and San Francisco. Soon we will launch nationwide and we need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
• Bursting: Without warning, a major incident occurs and multiple users begin live-streaming video into the app. We notify the entire user base, causing a massive burst of simultaneously connected clients. The core systems we build need to efficiently support traffic that can grow to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users today, and millions in the future.
• Analytics: We want to alert users to incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
• Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
• Extracting signal from noise: During major breaking news events, tensions are high and a lack of information persists. We build tools to raise facts and suppress noise.
• FM radio: We use software-defined radios to consume all radio dispatch in NYC, SF and eventually every major city, whether analog, digital, or trunked.

Our Stack - languages and technologies we use and teach
• Mobile: Swift (iOS), Java (Android)
• Web: React.js
• Server: Go, Node (for isolated systems)
• Systems: MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Firebase (for isolated systems)
• Infrastructure: Kubernetes on GCP

Role Description
• Our core challenges come from intersecting our growing internal datasets on user behavior and real time crime, fire, and medical incidents with large, messy external datasets from governmental and private sources.
• Work with a wide array of real-world data sources, with an inclination towards experimentation, to find new and better data sources that allow us to further customize our users’ notifications and overall experience.
• Work with the executive team in support of our mission by helping inform Mayors, Governors, Chiefs of Police, and other public figures with data-led analysis of the impact of Citizen on crime
• Lead projects that derive value from our unique, rich, and rapidly growing data.
• Distilling questions, wrangling data, and driving decisions with data analytics.
• Work with Engineering to evangelize data best practices and implement data analytics solutions.
• Working with Product to inform prioritization of roadmap through data analytics

Requirements
• Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, Math, Statistics, or related field.
• 5+ years of experience in data science or analytics.
• Proficiency in programming/scripting and experience with statistical packages like R, Python/Pandas, etc.
• Strong knowledge of relational databases and ability to write SQL code at an expert level.
• Aptitude with numbers, intellectual curiosity about metrics and measuring impact.
• Enjoys teaching and collaborating with others.

585,204.0,"About ShiftWe believe car buying should be fun, fair, and accessible to everyone. We’ve set out to transform an industry, using technology to bring transparency and convenience to the car buying process.

And we aren’t stopping there. We seek to bring that same openness and simplicity to car ownership too, with payments, maintenance, and insurance in one easy app. At Shift, we’re building the tools that empower people to buy, own, and sell the cars that make life go.

Shift is bringing transparency and trust to the used car industry. Data is core to this transformation, from building best-in-class pricing, to loan decisioning, to logistics optimization, to in-product recommendations. If you’re passionate about using data to fix an enormous, antiquated industry, you’ll fit right in.

The Data
Millions of cars are bought and sold in the US every year, but knowing exactly how much your car is worth is a challenge. We believe that fixing the used car industry requires providing customers... with fair, detailed pricing reports in beautiful, easy-to-understand interfaces. By combining as much data as we can get our hands on, from the millions of listings available online, to car auction sales, to every vehicle’s specific repair history, we’re building the most accurate, transparent pricing tool in the industry.

The Impact
As a two-sided marketplace, serving both car buyers and sellers, our vehicle data and pricing models are core to the business. As a data scientist at Shift, you’ll have a direct, immediate impact on the success of the company. Initial projects will include exploring data, building models, informing product decisions, overseeing experiments, and collaborating closely with engineers on our pricing team. Over time, you’ll play a crucial role in growing and mentoring a team of data scientists that will be involved in nearly every initiative at Shift, including lending, fraud, lead scoring, user acquisition, optimal resource allocation, vehicle routing, and more!

The Team
We are a friendly, helpful community of engineers with a diverse background of experience. We espouse autonomy, trust, and learning from each other. We believe that embedding data science into our engineering team provides a unique opportunity for significant autonomy and influence fully supported by the engineering resources you need.
We're looking for someone who will:
• Build and own data science models in collaboration with the engineering and business teams
• Suggest, run, and analyze experiments across the company
• Be part of a team…Help develop our data architecture, and work with our engineering team to guide our build out of data pipelines and machine learning infrastructure
• Use strong academic background to build high performing machine learning models

The ideal candidate will have:
• Knowledge of machine learning techniques, especially intuition for their benefits and drawbacks in real-world applications
• Experience wrangling data to explore new model features, build visualizations, and clean data
• 0- 3 years of experience working as a data scientist and experience working with multiple data architectures in production
• Proficiency in a statistical computing language (such as R or Python) and SQL.
• Strong knowledge of statistics and experimental design
• Curiosity, desire to learn, passion for providing a great product to customers
• Experience mentoring other data scientists, as well as excitement at being an individual contributor to start
• B.A. / B.S. / M.Sc. or equivalent degree in quantitative field. PhD a plus

Bonuses (but please still apply even if you don’t have them!):
• Production engineering experience. If you have engineering experience, that’s great, and basic coding skills are a must, but you’ll also be strongly supported by engineering for the heavy lifting, code-wise.
• Experience with automotive data. Love cars? Great! Never bought or owned a car? Also great! We’ve got car experts you can learn from.

If you’re not sure you fit all these descriptions, please still apply! We hire people, not lists of requirements, and we’d love to talk to you!

On diversity
Our company depends on balance and equality — between buyers and sellers, among employees, and in our relationships with customers.

Our mission to evolve car ownership and transform an industry is a challenging one. It can only be achieved by a team of diverse problem-solvers — engineers, designers, business people — from the same broad demographics as our customers.

Why join now?
We’ve built a small but highly talented team backed by >$275 million in funding from investors like DFJ, Goldman Sachs, BMW, and Nissan. In October 2018 we announced a deep partnership and a $140m round led by the third largest auto retailer in the US, Lithia Motors. With strong product-market fit and a great business in California, the next two years will be focused on scaling the business nationally.

Shift is the Bay Area’s #1 seller of used cars with $150 million in cars sold per year. We’re serving most of California and are gearing up to scale to new markets.

On SkillSoniq, with the click of a button, freelancers find their next on-site project and employers find their next freelancer. Our mission is to enable companies and workers to start working when and where they want, with the click of a button.

We cater to smaller companies who do not have the budget to hire full-time workers just yet, and rely on low cost, “low quality” outsourced work to get their companies going. Our local, specialized freelancers are affordable, high quality and work with clients on-site. This gives our clients a chance to test these freelancers in the workspace before giving them a full-time gig. This role is an opportunity to join the founding team, and help build a truly revolutionary product for freelancers and employers alike.

What's lacking in job portals today is that they stop collecting data... from job seekers after the job seeker gets a job. Hence, they never find out if an employer has hired someone on their portal. SkillSoniq, on the other hand, continuously seeks to collect data points from freelancers before and after they get a project. This helps us personalize our services to freelancers and employers, power our AI based engines, and ensure that companies and freelancers connect instantly with the click of a button.

More specifically, the job will entail:

1. Cleaning up, reviewing and improving our existing NLP based model (in Python) to enhance data intake, data manipulation and data output processes

2. Reviewing and understanding data output to refine the model on an ongoing basis

3. Using a combination of deep learning NLP and SVM models to convert our rule based recommender engine into a machine learning based engine. This will require creation of a training corpus that expands as more projects are posted and more employer/freelancer decisions are made on our app

4. Integrating NLP Python code into our Ruby on Rails code base on an ongoing basis, and helping make decisions on the architecture of the code and the recommender engine

5. Working in Python, NLP, PostGreSQL, and managing DevOps to ensure regular testing, functioning and deployment of code

• Fast learner. We're looking for team members who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies and don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. You should be able to adapt easily to meet the fast pace of a rapidly evolving research, development, and testing environment.
• Fearlessness. You think a working proof-of-concept is the best way to make a point. You strive on proving that speed and quality are not conflicting; that you can achieve both at the same time.
• Versatility. In addition to having an intimate knowledge of core engineering fields, you understand how all the pieces fit together into integrated systems, and how they impact performance.
• Passion. You feel ownership over everything you ship; you'd never call code or design ""released"" until you're confident it's correct. You pride yourself on efficient monitoring, strong documentation, and proper test coverage.
• A team player. You believe that you can achieve more on a team -- that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others' candid feedback for continuous improvement.
