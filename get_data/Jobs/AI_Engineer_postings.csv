,"We are looking for a Machine learning scientist to join our Science team and help us scale our ambitious Natural language processing (NLP) and ML (Vision, Speech) efforts to build the best conversational Artificial intelligence.

So far, each time we’ve incorporated new NLP models into the product, we’ve seen significant improvements to both the conversation quality, and the long-term user retention. In particular, our coreference resolution module (NeuralCoref) helped us understand the context in quick exchanges of short text messages measurably better. Our emotion classifier, called TorchMoji (trained on 1.6 billion tweets!) has let us create stronger empathy and more emotional connection to our users.

Your task will be to make our NLP stack and models 10x smarter. You’ll be able to train on our large scale conversation dataset (+100M messages), and you’ll see the output of your work in production, used by real users, in almost real time (we ship NLP models every week).

Along the... way, you’ll also publish open source implementations and contribute to the state-of-the-art in academic research in Machine learning. In 2018, our team already got papers accepted in several top conferences in AI/ML happening this year: ACL (current top conference in NLP) and ICLR (founded in 2013 by Yoshua Bengio & Yann Lecun) and we are on track to be featured in several other top AI/ML venues this year.

What You’ll Do

- Design and implement cutting-edge NLP models.

- Working with our engineering and product team, deploy those models in production to our conversation stack, and monitor and analyse their results.

- Along the way, publish some kick-ass research papers to top-tier conferences.

Who You Are

- MSc. or PhD in Computer science, engineering or a related field (Math, Physics, Statistics, …).

- Vision alignment: you believe everyone will talk to an AI everyday in 5 years and you are passionate to work hard to achieve this vision.

- Proficient in Python and at least one ML framework: PyTorch or Tensorflow.

- Familiarity with NLP “deep-learning style”: RNN, CNN, attention-based models, embeddings (the content of Richard Socher’s Stanford class for instance)

- Optional but appreciated:

- Familiar with “classical” NLP tasks and tools: syntactic and semantic parsing, semantic relations extraction (openIE), co-reference resolution

- Knowledge of C/C++ and Carnegie Mellon’s DyNet (a C++ neural net framework) would be appreciated

We want to develop a strong culture of ownership where all team members are top-level builders and doers (no long meetings here!). We’ve done other startups in the past, so we want to always find the intersection between what makes you most excited, and what makes sense for the company.

,"Argo AI was founded to tackle one of the most challenging applications in computer science, robotics and artificial intelligence with self-driving vehicles. Argo AI is developing and deploying the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer vision to help build safe and efficient self-driving vehicles that enable these transformations and more. The challenges are significant, but we are a team that believes in tackling hard, meaningful problems to improve the world.

We are building a high-performance team that is excited by complex engineering challenges and is passionate about making transportation safer, more affordable and accessible for all.

Machine learning, more specifically deep learning algorithms (detection, segmentation, and fusion tasks) are one of the main challenges for self-driving vehicles and a key part of our autonomy stack. Self-driving cars need to perceive objects and actors around the vehicle to make the correct decisions. The... implementation must meet rigorous real time constraints and reliably report detections in 2D or 3D spaces. Ultimately, we must not only solve the algorithm challenges but produce safety-quality high performance software. So this position is as much a software challenge as it is a core algorithm challenge.

We are seeking hands on candidates who have a mix of computer vision, machine learning expertise, embedded and real time constraints and low level accelerators (FPGA, GPUs). We are looking for practitioners who will be deep in code, and are technically strong in software and (ideally) strong in applied machine learning algorithms. Candidates need not have worked on self-driving, or robotics applications. Candidates with extremely strong skills in some areas but weaker in others will be considered with a bias towards strong software engineering skills.

What You’ll Do
• Core models used for scene understanding that are front and center in the perception pipeline
• Research projects improving not only our current image space but also radar, LiDar space detection algorithms and best methods to fuse together to improve performance
• Turning algorithm exploration that performs best on rigorous and pragmatic A vs B experiments evaluated extensively on data into models/software running on the vehicle
• Working with data collection to select and label relevant data to improve our supervised training
• Working with label tooling team to adjust labeling policies, and approaches to obtain the best label set needed

What We're Looking For
• Degree in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Robotics or a related field
• Strong software engineering skills are required but we are language agnostic
• A willingness to gain stronger software engineering knowledge and deep expertise in C++ and/or python is required
• Strong theoretical and applied knowledge of relevant subsets of detection algorithms
• Strong desire for candidates with hands on experience that have deployed real products or platforms into the real world and intimately understand the challenges of working with complex systems
• Experienced software engineer or research with a track record of real world applications incorporating machine learning and computer vision
• Python
• C++
• Realtime applications
• Experience with real world applications of machine learning and computer vision
• Classification, scene understanding, object detection classes of algorithms
• Familiarity with Mxnet, caffe, tensorflow or other similar deep net or machine learning packages
• GPU expertise
At Argo AI, we have a strong emphasis on creating a highly effective team environment. Thus, we seek candidates that can work effectively with others across a broad range of disciplines.
