Today, the biggest bottleneck in bringing new treatments to patients is the clinical trial. On average, getting a drug through the trial process takes nearly a decade and frequently costs $100M+. And the problem is only getting worse.

At TrialSpark, we don’t believe it has to be this way. Through technology and a new operational model, we’re reimaging how clinical trials are run, with the mission of bringing new treatments to patients faster.

We do this by partnering with physicians to enable them to run clinical trials within their existing practices. By providing the technology platform, equipment, and staffing,TrialSpark alleviates the operational burden of clinical research, enabling physicians to focus on what they do best -- patient care. And by bringing clinical research to physician practices, TrialSpark is enabling access for the 98% of patients who are never exposed to clinical trial opportunities.

About the role

Delivering a clinical trial across... multiple trial sites is a highly complex endeavor, involving lots of different people, processes, and logistics. And running numerous clinical trials at once, across a nationwide site network, increases the complexity of the problem exponentially.

As a Senior Operations Analyst, your focus will be helping us to manage this complexity. You will be responsible for developing a deep, data-driven understanding of our operational model and identifying the key leverage points to drive greater efficiency. You’ll map out the exact activities required to deliver a clinical trial and locate opportunities to reduce time and cost. Example questions you’ll help us answer include:
• How many people do we need to staff a clinical trial? What are the primary drivers of the size and makeup of the team? Given the needs of the trial and the workloads, capabilities, and geographical locations of the various team members, who should be included in the team?
• What does it cost to run a clinical trial? What are the major drivers of these costs and what improvements can we make to the model to drive efficiency? Where do we build vs. buy software?
• In what ways can we optimize our physical trial operations? Can we better route our staff and resources between sites? What does an efficient clinical logistics network look like?
• Based on the forecasted growth of the business, how many people do we need to hire for each role, and by when?

About you

This is a core operational role for TrialSpark, We’re looking for highly talented candidates with an extensive background in analytical problem solving. Candidates for this role should be able to take complex, open-ended problems and develop structured, data-driven solutions.

An ideal candidate:
• You have a deep analytical background with experience in an Operational science or research capacity, and are passionate about breaking down and understanding complex systems end-to-end. Prior experience could include data science, operations, consulting, or finance.
• You have strong technical chops — you’ve lived in Excel, can write SELECT statements in your sleep, and can Python or R your way in and out of any situation.
• You are excited about working cross-functionally with operations, finance, product, engineering, and data to develop innovative solutions to challenging operational problems.
• You are proactive, strategic, implementation-focused, and ready to roll up your sleeves and make an impact right away
• You are low ego, collaborative, and a fast-learner

Citizen’s mission is to protect the world. We began by opening the NYC and San Francisco 911 system to local Citizen app users, creating access to real-time crime and safety information. By increasing situational awareness and transparency, we hope communities will become safer than ever before.

Since our launch, 6% of New Yorkers use our app every month, and that growth is accelerating. We launched San Francisco last fall, and over 1% has already joined the Citizen safety network. We send over 4 million nearby crime notifications each month, alerting our users to emergencies and dangerous situations near them. Citizen broke both recent NYC terror incidents to people nearby, keeping thousands in the vicinity safer and informed in real-time. Citizen has been featured on local NYC news over 100 times in the past 3 months.

We’re looking for passionate, mission-driven individuals to help take the Citizen app to the next level as we scale up new cities and expand... globally.

Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital and Founder’s Fund.

Our Challenges
• Scaling: We have one of the fastest growing organic user bases in NYC, and right now we’re geo-restricted to New York City and San Francisco. Soon we will launch nationwide and we need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
• Bursting: Without warning, a major incident occurs and multiple users begin live-streaming video into the app. We notify the entire user base, causing a massive burst of simultaneously connected clients. The core systems we build need to efficiently support traffic that can grow to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users today, and millions in the future.
• Analytics: We want to alert users to incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
• Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
• Extracting signal from noise: During major breaking news events, tensions are high and a lack of information persists. We build tools to raise facts and suppress noise.
• FM radio: We use software-defined radios to consume all radio dispatch in NYC, SF and eventually every major city, whether analog, digital, or trunked.

Our Stack - languages and technologies we use and teach
• Mobile: Swift (iOS), Java (Android)

123.8,"About Trialspark
Today, the biggest bottleneck in bringing new treatments to patients is the clinical trial. On average, getting a drug through the trial process takes nearly a decade and frequently costs $100M+. And the problem is only getting worse.
At TrialSpark, we don’t believe it has to be this way. Through technology and a new operational model, we’re reimaging how clinical trials are run, with the mission of bringing new treatments to patients faster.
We do this by partnering with physicians to enable them to run clinical trials within their existing practices. By providing the technology platform, equipment, and staffing,TrialSpark alleviates the operational burden of clinical research, enabling physicians to focus on what they do best -- patient care. And by bringing clinical research to physician practices, TrialSpark is enabling access for the 98% of patients who are never exposed to clinical trial opportunities.
About the role
Delivering a clinical trial across multiple... trial sites is a highly complex endeavor, involving lots of different people, processes, and logistics. And running numerous clinical trials at once, across a nationwide site network, increases the complexity of the problem exponentially.
As a Senior Operations Analyst, your focus will be helping us to manage this complexity. You will be responsible for developing a deep, data-driven understanding of our operational model and identifying the key leverage points to drive greater efficiency. You’ll map out the exact activities required to deliver a clinical trial and locate opportunities to reduce time and cost. Example questions you’ll help us answer include:
How many people do we need to staff a clinical trial? What are the primary drivers of the size and makeup of the team? Given the needs of the trial and the workloads, capabilities, and geographical locations of the various team members, who should be included in the team?
What does it cost to run a clinical trial? What are the major drivers of these costs and what improvements can we make to the model to drive efficiency? Where do we build vs. buy software?
In what ways can we optimize our physical trial operations? Can we better route our staff and resources between sites? What does an efficient clinical logistics network look like?
Based on the forecasted growth of the business, how many people do we need to hire for each role, and by when?
About you
This is a core operational role for TrialSpark, We’re looking for highly talented candidates with an extensive background in analytical problem solving. Candidates for this role should be able to take complex, open-ended problems and develop structured, data-driven solutions.
An ideal candidate:
You have a deep analytical background with experience in an Operational science or research capacity, and are passionate about breaking down and understanding complex systems end-to-end. Prior experience could include data science, operations, consulting, or finance.
You have strong technical chops — you’ve lived in Excel, can write SELECT statements in your sleep, and can Python or R your way in and out of any situation.
You are excited about working cross-functionally with operations, finance, product, engineering, and data to develop innovative solutions to challenging operational problems.
You are proactive, strategic, implementation-focused, and ready to roll up your sleeves and make an impact right away
You are low ego, collaborative, and a fast-learner
