You’ll build and maintain an evolving set of shared principles, shared tools, shared knowledge and most importantly shared behaviours for how we produce and manage data for insights across the company.
• To tackle the data for insights challenges at Spotify, we’ll need to work across the entire data preparation workflow, including generating data through instrumentation, normalising data into easy to query tables and producing flat tables that are ready to analyse. When light touch support to the community is not enough, you will embed in other teams to solve problems and develop new community resources as a result. When input to central support teams is not enough, we embed with our partners there to help design, build and activate shared data, tooling and /or infrastructure.
• You’ll work with data scientists to cultivate a shared practice for defining data collection requirements across all of our experiences. You’ll partner with central tooling and infrastructure teams to make sure it’s trivally easy for these requirements to be implemented by product teams.
• You’ll work with dedicated data production teams to identify opportunity to produce datasets centrally. You’ll be the lead designer for Spotify’s data, modelling data across the company and helping teams to identify and design data interoperably with their bounded context. You’ll work closely with tooling and infrastructure teams to ensure we have the tools we need to make it easy to produce and manage data for insights. When input is not enough, you’ll embed with our partners to help design, build or activate shared data, tooling and infrastructure.

Who you are
• You’re passionate about the role of modelled, analyst friendly data in maximizing a company’s potential as a learning organisation. Your passion for good practice is infectious. As you continuously improve your own practice, Spotify’s practice will improve alongside you.
• You’re collaborative. You work hands on with a wide variety of teams to ensure that both the most recent needs of the community are reflected in our shared practice and that behaviours of the community are changing to adopt it. When there are competing shared practices you facilitate discussions, providing your experienced perspective where needed, in order to establish a single view, e.g. the guiding principles or when to use which practice. When infrastructure is missing or incomplete you surface the needs and work with infra teams to ensure that they are understood.
• You’re innovative. You’re a builder. You show people the value of your ideas by bringing them to life in tangible, innovative ways. You work closely with central engineering and infrastructure teams to tackle the most complex challenges at Spotify are addressed in a sustainable way.
• You’re playful. You’re always looking for new ways to engage across disciplines to build engagement and cultivate a shared sense of ownership of the practice.
• You’re sincere. As community lead, you take an active interest in your own development and the development of other data scientists across the organisation.
• You have 5+ years as a practicing data scientist, analyst or data/analytics engineer.
• You have a high level of ability in data science languages such as SQL and Python and/or R.
• You have some previous experience leading data scientists in developing and adopting shared practice is essential (e.g. building an internal community of practice, contributing to open source)
• You have extensive experience working with engineers, product managers and designers in a product environment to decide what data to collect and how to collect it, to enable the data science downstream.

Citizen’s mission is to protect the world. We began by opening the NYC and San Francisco 911 system to local Citizen app users, creating access to real-time crime and safety information. By increasing situational awareness and transparency, we hope communities will become safer than ever before.

Since our launch, 6% of New Yorkers use our app every month, and that growth is accelerating. We launched San Francisco last fall, and over 1% has already joined the Citizen safety network. We send over 4 million nearby crime notifications each month, alerting our users to emergencies and dangerous situations near them. Citizen broke both recent NYC terror incidents to people nearby, keeping thousands in the vicinity safer and informed in real-time. Citizen has been featured on local NYC news over 100 times in the past 3 months.

We’re looking for passionate, mission-driven individuals to help take the Citizen app to the next level as we scale up new cities and expand... globally.

Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital and Founder’s Fund.

Our Challenges
• Scaling: We have one of the fastest growing organic user bases in NYC, and right now we’re geo-restricted to New York City and San Francisco. Soon we will launch nationwide and we need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
• Bursting: Without warning, a major incident occurs and multiple users begin live-streaming video into the app. We notify the entire user base, causing a massive burst of simultaneously connected clients. The core systems we build need to efficiently support traffic that can grow to hundreds of thousands of concurrent users today, and millions in the future.
• Analytics: We want to alert users to incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
• Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
• Extracting signal from noise: During major breaking news events, tensions are high and a lack of information persists. We build tools to raise facts and suppress noise.
• FM radio: We use software-defined radios to consume all radio dispatch in NYC, SF and eventually every major city, whether analog, digital, or trunked.

Our Stack - languages and technologies we use and teach
• Mobile: Swift (iOS), Java (Android)
• Web: React.js
• Server: Go, Node (for isolated systems)
• Systems: MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Firebase (for isolated systems)
• Infrastructure: Kubernetes on GCP

Role Description
• Our core challenges come from intersecting our growing internal datasets on user behavior and real time crime, fire, and medical incidents with large, messy external datasets from governmental and private sources.
• Work with a wide array of real-world data sources, with an inclination towards experimentation, to find new and better data sources that allow us to further customize our users’ notifications and overall experience.
• Work with the executive team in support of our mission by helping inform Mayors, Governors, Chiefs of Police, and other public figures with data-led analysis of the impact of Citizen on crime
• Lead projects that derive value from our unique, rich, and rapidly growing data.
• Distilling questions, wrangling data, and driving decisions with data analytics.
• Work with Engineering to evangelize data best practices and implement data analytics solutions.
• Working with Product to inform prioritization of roadmap through data analytics

Requirements
• Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, Math, Statistics, or related field.
• 5+ years of experience in data science or analytics.
• Proficiency in programming/scripting and experience with statistical packages like R, Python/Pandas, etc.
• Strong knowledge of relational databases and ability to write SQL code at an expert level.
• Aptitude with numbers, intellectual curiosity about metrics and measuring impact.
• Enjoys teaching and collaborating with others.

The University of Virginia (UVA) has announced plans to establish a School of Data Science, an effort made possible in part by the largest private gift in the institution’s 200-year history. The School of Data Science – UVA’s 12th school and the first established since 2007 – will position the University as a global leader in efforts to improve society through teaching and research based on the powerful, emerging field of data science. It builds on a foundation set in place at UVA by the Data Science Institute (DSI), a pan-University institute established in 2013 that grants graduate degrees and has a dual mission in education and research. The new School of Data Science proposes to ultimately offer both doctoral and undergraduate degree programs and certificate programs, helping to meet soaring demand for qualified data science professionals in a field that plays a key role in the... global information-based economy.

To realize the new School of Data Science vision, UVA seeks applicants for 12-month Open Rank General Faculty teaching track appointments in the area of data science related to education and policy. The DSI is committed to becoming a world leader in data science for the social good. To achieve this goal, we will recruit faculty at all levels who possess a diversity of life experiences. We especially encourage applications from individuals who are members of underrepresented groups and who have worked to support the broadening of student access to data science careers. Candidates are expected to develop and teach potentially both residential and online courses primarily for the Master of Science in Data Science program, but will also build and teach courses in data science for education and policy independently and jointly in the Curry School of Education and Human Development and the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. Candidates with experience and interest in policy analysis and educational analytics with backgrounds in areas related to data science such as: data mining and machine learning; data visualization; data integration and engineering; data management, acquisition and dissemination; and data ethics, law, policy and social implications are encouraged to apply. Currently teaching faculty spend the majority of their time teaching with a balance of effort dedicated to research and service responsibilities. Research at the intersection of data science and education and public policy will be an important part of the collaboration with the other schools. Initial applied research projects will focus on leveraging data science strategies to support individuals to complete postsecondary education and achieve better workforce outcomes, through close partnerships with public agencies and organizations. Service time includes roles in developing and building the new School of Data Science and commitments to help achieve student and team success.

UVA is proud to have a strong culture of collaboration and collegiality and is committed to creating collaborative and diverse environments necessary to develop and deliver quality educational programs. Successful candidates will help build bridges and will be a valuable part of creating cross-disciplinary programs with Curry and Batten; collaborate with both University faculty and public agency partners on applied research projects; teach and advise students at the undergraduate and graduate levels; mentor capstone research projects and perform service to the institution and the profession, locally, nationally and internationally.

A Ph.D. in a relevant field is required. A commitment to teaching excellence is essential, as is evidence of an explicit commitment to diversity and of advancing understanding and outcomes for underrepresented groups. Candidates with some experience teaching in an online format are preferred, however instructional design and related technical support will be provided to those interested in teaching online.

And we aren’t stopping there. We seek to bring that same openness and simplicity to car ownership too, with payments, maintenance, and insurance in one easy app. At Shift, we’re building the tools that empower people to buy, own, and sell the cars that make life go.

Shift is bringing transparency and trust to the used car industry. Data is core to this transformation, from building best-in-class pricing, to loan decisioning, to logistics optimization, to in-product recommendations. If you’re passionate about using data to fix an enormous, antiquated industry, you’ll fit right in.

The Data
Millions of cars are bought and sold in the US every year, but knowing exactly how much your car is worth is a challenge. We believe that fixing the used car industry requires providing customers... with fair, detailed pricing reports in beautiful, easy-to-understand interfaces. By combining as much data as we can get our hands on, from the millions of listings available online, to car auction sales, to every vehicle’s specific repair history, we’re building the most accurate, transparent pricing tool in the industry.

The Impact
As a two-sided marketplace, serving both car buyers and sellers, our vehicle data and pricing models are core to the business. As a data scientist at Shift, you’ll have a direct, immediate impact on the success of the company. Initial projects will include exploring data, building models, informing product decisions, overseeing experiments, and collaborating closely with engineers on our pricing team. Over time, you’ll play a crucial role in growing and mentoring a team of data scientists that will be involved in nearly every initiative at Shift, including lending, fraud, lead scoring, user acquisition, optimal resource allocation, vehicle routing, and more!

The Team
We are a friendly, helpful community of engineers with a diverse background of experience. We espouse autonomy, trust, and learning from each other.

Bonuses (but please still apply even if you don’t have them!):
• Production engineering experience. If you have engineering experience, that’s great, and basic coding skills are a must, but you’ll also be strongly supported by engineering for the heavy lifting, code-wise.
• Experience with automotive data. Love cars? Great! Never bought or owned a car? Also great! We’ve got car experts you can learn from.

If you’re not sure you fit all these descriptions, please still apply! We hire people, not lists of requirements, and we’d love to talk to you!

On diversity
Our company depends on balance and equality — between buyers and sellers, among employees, and in our relationships with customers.

Our mission to evolve car ownership and transform an industry is a challenging one. It can only be achieved by a team of diverse problem-solvers — engineers, designers, business people — from the same broad demographics as our customers.
