,"Touted by many as a BILLION dollar idea, SkillSoniq is building an ""Uber for Local Freelancers"" AI driven app to revolutionize the old school recruitment space. On SkillSoniq, with the click of a button, freelancers find their next on-site project and employers find their next freelancer. Our mission is to enable companies and workers to start working when and where they want, with the click of a button.

We cater to smaller companies who do not have the budget to hire full-time workers just yet, and rely on low cost, “low quality” outsourced work to get their companies going. Our local, specialized freelancers are affordable, high quality and work with clients on-site. This gives our clients a chance to test these freelancers in the workspace before giving them a full-time gig. This role is an opportunity to join the founding team, and help build a truly revolutionary product for freelancers and employers alike.

What's lacking in job portals today is that they stop collecting data... from job seekers after the job seeker gets a job. Hence, they never find out if an employer has hired someone on their portal. SkillSoniq, on the other hand, continuously seeks to collect data points from freelancers before and after they get a project. This helps us personalize our services to freelancers and employers, power our AI based engines, and ensure that companies and freelancers connect instantly with the click of a button.

4. Work as a generalist, where he/she both builds models in Python to support the business case, and analyzes market response / data to figure out patterns

More specifically, the job will entail:

1. Cleaning up, reviewing and improving our existing NLP based model (in Python) to enhance data intake, data manipulation and data output processes

2. Reviewing and understanding data output to refine the model on an ongoing basis

3. Using a combination of deep learning NLP and SVM models to convert our rule based recommender engine into a machine learning based engine. This will require creation of a training corpus that expands as more projects are posted and more employer/freelancer decisions are made on our app

4. Integrating NLP Python code into our Ruby on Rails code base on an ongoing basis, and helping make decisions on the architecture of the code and the recommender engine

5. Working in Python, NLP, PostGreSQL, and managing DevOps to ensure regular testing, functioning and deployment of code

Desired Skills and Experience:

1. Candidate should be able to work independently without much direction, other than the founder discussing the business case and desired outcomes

2. Candidate should be based in New York and available to work ~10 a week. Should not hesitate to work longer hours when required

The Role

Salesforce is looking for both Senior, Lead and Principal Data / Deep Learning / Machine Learning Engineers with Java, Python, Scala and/or Spark experience, to help us take on one of the world’s most extensive data sets and transform it into amazing products that feel like magic. You will work on cutting-edge AI applications and products. Brainstorming data product ideas with data scientists and engineers to build data products used by hundreds of millions people every day.

A Typical Day For You Might Include The Following
• Developing data infrastructure that ingest and transforms data from different sources and customers at scale.
• Creating machine/deep learning infrastructure that generalizes across hundreds of thousands of... Salesforce customers, but is expressive enough to generate high lift.
• Partner end-to-end with Product Managers and Data Scientists to understand customer requirements and design prototypes and bring ideas to production
• Working with internal product teams to ingest their data and sprinkle machine/deep learning fairy dust on their products.
• Participating in meal conversations with your team members about really important topics, such as: Should the cuteness of panda bears be a factor in their survivability? Is love a decision tree or a regression model? How far ahead would society be today if we had 12 fingers instead of 10?

What We Care About

• We’re a growing, diverse team and we work together on projects. We love to collaborate and help each other, and we want someone to share that ideology.
• You have to be a very quick learner - we face new challenges every day, anything that ranges between the operating model of a financial services companies, conversation model for chatbots, tinkering with convolutional and recurrent networks, to how to make Spark work with the S3 file system. No school could prepare you for all of these, so you need to be very quick on your feet.
• Self-starter who can see the big picture, and prioritize their work to make the largest impact on the business’ and customer’s vision and requirements
• Excellent communication, leadership, and collaboration skills

Preferred Skills: (different teams will care about some of the following over others)
